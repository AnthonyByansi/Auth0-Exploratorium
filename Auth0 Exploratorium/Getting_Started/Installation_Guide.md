# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the installation process of Auth0 and help you set up the necessary dependencies to start integrating Auth0 into your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version X.X.X or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version X.X.X or higher)

## Steps

Follow these steps to install Auth0:

1. **Sign up for an Auth0 account:** If you haven't done so already, visit the [Auth0 website](https://auth0.com/) and sign up for a free account. This will give you access to the Auth0 dashboard and allow you to manage your applications and configurations.

2. **Create a new Auth0 application:** Once you're logged into the Auth0 dashboard, navigate to the "Applications" section and click on the "Create Application" button. Provide a name for your application and select the appropriate application type (e.g., Single Page Application, Regular Web Application, Mobile, or API).

3. **Configure application settings:** After creating the application, you'll be redirected to its settings page. Here, you can configure various settings specific to your application, such as allowed callback URLs, allowed logout URLs, and more. Refer to the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/dashboard/application-settings) for detailed information on configuring application settings.

4. **Install Auth0 SDK or library:** Depending on your chosen technology stack, you'll need to install the Auth0 SDK or library. Visit the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started) to find the appropriate installation instructions for your preferred programming language and framework.

5. **Initialize Auth0 in your application:** Once you have the SDK or library installed, you'll need to initialize Auth0 in your application code. This typically involves providing your Auth0 credentials, such as the Client ID and Domain, and configuring the necessary authentication and authorization settings. Refer to the SDK documentation and guides for specific instructions on initializing Auth0 in your application.

6. **Test authentication flow:** With Auth0 integrated into your application, it's time to test the authentication flow. Run your application locally or deploy it to a development environment and ensure that the authentication functionality works as expected. Test features such as user sign-up, login, logout, and any additional authentication methods you've implemented.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and configured Auth0 in your application. You can now begin leveraging Auth0's identity and access management features to secure your application and authenticate your users.
