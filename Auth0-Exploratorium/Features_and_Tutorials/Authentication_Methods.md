# Authentication Methods

Auth0 provides a wide range of authentication methods to cater to various use cases and security requirements. This guide will introduce you to some of the key authentication methods offered by Auth0, along with tutorials and examples to help you implement them effectively in your applications.

## Username and Password Authentication

The most common and widely used authentication method is username and password authentication. Auth0 supports traditional username and password-based authentication for applications that require user login functionality. You can integrate this method using Auth0 Lock, a widget provided by Auth0, or by using the Auth0 API directly.

**Tutorial:** To learn how to implement username and password authentication using Auth0, refer to the [Username and Password Authentication Tutorial](tutorials/username_password_authentication.md).

## Social Authentication

Social authentication allows users to log in to your application using their existing social media accounts, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more. Auth0 simplifies the process of integrating social authentication by providing pre-built integrations with popular social identity providers.

**Tutorial:** To learn how to implement social authentication using Auth0, refer to the [Social Authentication Tutorial](tutorials/social_authentication.md).

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide multiple pieces of evidence to verify their identity. Auth0 supports various MFA methods, including SMS-based codes, email-based codes, push notifications, and authenticator apps.

**Tutorial:** To learn how to implement Multi-Factor Authentication using Auth0, refer to the [Multi-Factor Authentication Tutorial](tutorials/multi_factor_authentication.md).

## Passwordless Authentication

Passwordless authentication eliminates the need for users to remember and enter passwords. Instead, users can authenticate using alternative methods such as email, SMS, or magic links. Auth0 provides built-in support for passwordless authentication, making it easy to implement this convenient and secure authentication method.

**Tutorial:** To learn how to implement passwordless authentication using Auth0, refer to the [Passwordless Authentication Tutorial](tutorials/passwordless_authentication.md).

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without the need to provide credentials repeatedly. Auth0 supports various SSO protocols and provides seamless integration with popular identity providers, enabling you to implement SSO functionality quickly and efficiently.

**Tutorial:** To learn how to implement Single Sign-On using Auth0, refer to the [Single Sign-On Tutorial](tutorials/single_sign_on.md).

## Custom Authentication

In addition to the provided authentication methods, Auth0 allows you to implement custom authentication solutions tailored to your specific requirements. This gives you the flexibility to integrate with existing authentication systems, third-party services, or implement unique authentication flows that go beyond the standard methods offered.

**Tutorial:** To learn how to implement custom authentication using Auth0, refer to the [Custom Authentication Tutorial](tutorials/custom_authentication.md).
